# read_hamrc

In this code, TB hamiltonian is stored in a dict called HR.hr.
All rvectors as key.

Delete most of the functions in the original code.
Only keeping (and revising) these:
    1. read HR to a dict
    2. copy a HR class instance
    3. write HR based on HR class

The name of the module (as a single file): **read_hamrc.py**
name for "Read Hamiltonian Compact version"

This code is designed to :
* Be easy to read
* Take no changes to raw data
* Be flexible for incorporating into other codes or further developing.
